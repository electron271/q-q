static MD: &str = r#"# Credits
Well, this will be a long trip.. use the up and down arrows to scroll (â‡…)

## Documentation
SoupDevHub - README.md (most of it)
electron271 - README.md (minor changes), CONTRIBUTING.MD

## Code
electron271 - all of the code
dependabot - will hopefully help us

## Testing
SoupDevHub - Windows
electron271 - Debian

## Special thanks
My Cat - motivation
You - ..if you contributed (Actually, we really appreciate you for even launching this application)

## DISCLAMER (yes really)
q>q is not designed to be useful. It is a proof of concept application and also just a fun application to use when you're bored!

Check out everyone mentioned (yes including yourself)


..now view some real application not this junk
