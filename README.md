# Is this actully useful in any way?

# Documentation

To compile/install/run q>q, you need rust, which you can install [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). You will also need to run `git clone https://github.com/unstable-errors/q-q.git` if you're on Linux/MacOS. If you're on Windows download and unzip the zip file of the source code. If there is a release, get the source code (or the binary and run that!)
